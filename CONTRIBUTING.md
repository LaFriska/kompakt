# Contributing

Kompakt is at an early phase of development, and Kompakt is completely
free to use and open source. We encourage experience Java programmers to 
contribute to Kompakt.

## Issues
- If you find issues, bugs or security risks of any form, we would appreciate
a post on the "issues" section of our GitHub page.
- If you wish to fix an issue or a bug, please fork the repository, clone it onto your local machine,
and submit a pull request.

## Code Etiquette
When submitting pull requests, please try your best to meet the following 
criteria (though there are a lot of wiggle room and we do not always require these points.)

1. Braces must go inline with the statement.

Do this
```
if(){
   /...
}
```
Don't do this
```
if()
{
   /...
}
```
2. Please add Java documentation to `public` methods. 
3. Abide to Java naming conventions. 
4. Be descriptive in your pull request, write down the changes you have made,
and the bugs you fixed.
5. Run the test cases and ensure they are still working.
# Adding Test Cases

One could never have too many test cases! We'd always appreciate contribution
in the form of writing more test cases, especially testing edge cases they have
not already been tested. Once again, please submit these in the form of pull requests.

**Other than that, we thank you very much for contributions of any form to Kompakt.**
